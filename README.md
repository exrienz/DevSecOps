**Title: Evolution of Software Development Methodologies**

**Subtitle: Understanding the Transition from Waterfall to Agile to DevOps**

**Waterfall Methodology:**
- Linear project management approach
- Sequential phases with no overlap
- Requires proper documentation and clear requirements
- Benefits: Simple, well-defined phases, easy tracking, meeting deadlines
- Drawbacks: High risk, difficult to make changes, delays, lacks adaptability

**Agile Methodology:**
- Values and principles outlined in the Agile Manifesto
- Incremental and iterative development
- Prioritizes user functionality and continuous improvement
- Benefits: Collaboration, flexibility, minimal planning, concurrent development
- Drawbacks: Unsuitable for complex dependencies, high risk, customer dependency, lack of documentation

**DevOps Methodology:**
- Extension of Agile principles
- Collaboration between development (Dev) and operations (Ops) teams
- Emphasizes automation, continuous integration, and rapid deployment
- Advantages: Constant communication, reduced software failures, rapid provisioning, automated testing, faster updates, fewer post-release errors, improved trust
- How DevOps is superior to Agile: Addresses developer-operation team gap

**DevOps Principles:**
- Automation, iterations, self-service, continuous improvement, continuous testing, collaboration

**Waterfall vs. Agile vs. DevOps:**
- Waterfall and Agile deploy code at the end, DevOps deploys after every commit
- DevOps helps secure the development process from errors
