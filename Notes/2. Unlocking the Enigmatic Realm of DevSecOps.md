## DevSecOps Common Pipeline Phases

### Plan
- Collect customer requirements and feedback.
- Create a product roadmap for future development.
- Segment the workflow into specific tasks for execution.
- Allows for rapid results, issue resolution, and adaptation to changes.

### Code
- Developers write code for the software product.
- Use standard toolkits and plugins for consistent code.
- Tools help resolve issues found during code testing.

### Build
- Create a basic version of the product using a suitable programming language.
- Code is committed to the shared repository.
- Compilation process checks code quality and may require approval.
- Artifacts are generated for deployment.

### Test
- Test the software product using both manual and automated tests.
- Manual user acceptance tests identify issues and refinements.
- Automated tests check security, compliance, and load testing.
- Testing occurs in a dedicated environment.

### Deploy
- Move the application to production.
- Use automation for minor code changes.
- Major changes are deployed to a production-like environment for testing.
- Implement a blue-green deployment strategy for updates.
- Ensure no service disruptions during changes.

### Operate
- Operations team ensures smooth application operation.
- Resolves system errors and network issues.
- Automatically scales resources to handle demand fluctuations.
- Collects metrics and logs for performance analysis.

### Monitor
- Continuously monitor the delivered software product.
- Identify errors, uptime, and downtime.
- Monitor the DevSecOps pipeline for productivity bottlenecks.
- Collect user feedback and share it with the development team.
