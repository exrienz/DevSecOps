# What is DevSecOps?

- DevSecOps combines culture, practices, and tools.
- Aims to deliver quality software quickly.
- Combines development (Dev), security (Sec), and operations (Ops).
- Focuses on high-quality, secure products.
- Enhances collaboration among teams.
- Supports the entire software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Empowers automation and change management.
- Improves organizational efficiency.

## DevSecOps Business Values

- Saves time and money through automation.
- Enhances software lifecycle predictability.
- Fosters a culture of innovation and experimentation.
- Promotes higher quality and continuous releases.
- Motivates staff to write clean, reliable code.

## Main Goals of DevSecOps Methodology

1. **Low Error Rate**
   - Continuous testing and monitoring.
   - Reduces errors and ensures dependable releases.

2. **Achieve Business and Customer Requirements**
   - Unified focus on high-quality, quick development.
   - Automation for continuous development and deployment.

3. **Enhance Productivity**
   - Replace manual processes with automation.
   - Facilitates testing, deployment, and monitoring.

4. **Manage Interaction Between Different Departments**
   - Breaks traditional barriers to team collaboration.

5. **Optimize Development Tasks and Responsibilities**
   - Streamlines workflows for secure, cost-effective development.

6. **Improve Strategies and Programs**
   - Utilizes automated tools for integration, testing, and deployment.

7. **Generate Scalable Infrastructure Platform**
   - Enables faster, more predictable release processes.
   - Manages audit trials for compliance.

8. **Faster Feedback**
   - Establishes automated testing and reporting.
   - Speeds up software updates and performance enhancements.

## Benefits of DevSecOps

1. **Speed**
   - Quick product releases with streamlined processes.
   - Utilizes automation for timely deliveries.

2. **Lower Deployment Failure**
   - Identifies code errors early through continuous testing.
   - Promotes collaboration and reduces deployment failures.

3. **Improves Efficiency**
   - Automates tasks to save developers' time.
   - Increases efficiency through parallel workflows and scalable infrastructure.

4. **Innovation**
   - Accelerates product delivery, outpacing competitors.
   - Fosters end-user satisfaction and regular improvements.

5. **Reliability**
   - Updates existing products without disrupting users.
   - Ensures a predictable and efficient development process.
   - Detects and fixes issues, improving reliability.

6. **Cost Savings**
   - Eliminates project complexity and budget overruns.
   - Reduces maintenance and upgrade costs.

## Building Blocks of DevSecOps

### People
- Enhance scalability, agility, and delivery pace.
- Hire or train individuals with technical skills.
- Foster collaboration among development, IT operations, and quality assurance teams.
- Ensure efficient teamwork for a common goal.

### Process
- Choose appropriate development processes and workflows.
- Improve product quality and security.
- Enhance productivity and transition to advanced infrastructure.
- Focus on innovation and efficiency.

### Products/Technology
- Make informed choices to avoid technical debt.
- Select programming languages, tools, and infrastructure services.
- Achieve service consumption, agility, scalability, and value.

## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) in DevSecOps

### Continuous Integration (CI)
- Integrates quick code changes into a shared repository.
- Enables multiple daily code changes verified by automated tests.
- Facilitates bug detection and rapid fixes.
- Allows parallel development.
- Provides immediate issue feedback.
- Optimizes product budget.
- Ensures easy deployment and predictability.

## Continuous Delivery (CD)
- Extends CI by thoroughly testing and validating builds.
- Ensures always-releasable builds.
- Requires automated deployment.
- Removes deployment complexity.
- Accelerates customer feedback and iteration.

## Continuous Deployment (CD)
- Deploys configuration changes, new features, and error fixes to production.
- Automates deployment without manual intervention.
- Releases changes within minutes after passing automated tests.
- Automates repetitive tasks.
- Ensures flawless, secure deployment.
- Improves production continuously.
- Integrates processes and teams in a unified pipeline.

*Note*: Continuous Deployment (CD) includes Continuous Delivery (CD), but CD can refer to either continuous delivery or continuous deployment.
