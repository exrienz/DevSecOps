# Security Measures During DevSecOps Planning Phase

1. **Collaboration:** To maintain a continuous focus on security within DevSecOps, the team engages in collaborative discussions and reviews to define their security strategy during the planning phase. These discussions should revolve around enhancing both security and performance.

2. **Understanding Requirements:** Once the team comprehends the business needs, encompassing functionalities and performance objectives, they proceed to gather security requirements. These may encompass acceptance test criteria, threat defense models, and related aspects.

3. **Comprehensive Planning:** During this phase, a detailed plan is formulated, specifying the where, how, and when of security testing activities. The plan's primary objective is to ensure thorough threat and vulnerability analysis throughout the project's lifecycle to maintain its security. This planning process may utilize tools such as Cyberplanner, Service Now, and Jira.

4. **Threat Modeling:** Threat modeling is a critical exercise conducted during the planning stage. Its purpose is to:
   - Identify potential issues before the coding phase commences.
   - Highlight architectural and design weaknesses that might evade detection through other means.
   - Identify high-risk components.
   - Determine the security controls to be implemented and establish priorities.
   - Develop a fuzz testing plan to detect coding errors.
   - Prepare abuse cases, optimizing the utilization of the testing budget.

5. **Secure Code Training and Awareness:** The development team is equipped with secure code training and heightened awareness to empower them to write secure code from the outset.

6. **Security Tools Proficiency:** Developers are also trained in the effective utilization of security tools, including instructions on when and where to deploy them.

In the DevSecOps planning phase, these security measures are paramount to ensuring the continuous integration of security practices while comprehensively addressing business requirements and potential threats.

# Threat Modeling: A Clear and Future-Proof Approach

Threat modeling is a systematic process that seamlessly integrates with the DevOps workflow. Unlike traditional software development life cycles (SDLC), where threat modeling typically occurs during the design phase, in DevSecOps, it is initiated during the planning stage. This strategic positioning offers numerous advantages, which include:

**1. Detecting Hidden Flaws:** It uncovers architectural and design vulnerabilities that often elude detection through other means.

**2. High-Risk Component Identification:** It pinpoints high-risk components within the application's structure.

**3. Prioritizing Security Controls:** It aids in the identification and prioritization of security controls that need implementation.

**4. Fuzzing Test Planning:** It facilitates the creation of a comprehensive fuzzing test plan.

**5. Abuse Case Preparation:** It assists in preparing abuse cases for potential security breaches.

## The Benefits of Threat Modeling:

**1. Enhanced Operational Visibility:** Threat modeling enhances operational visibility by spotlighting potential attack surfaces before an actual security breach occurs. This is achieved through:

   - Vulnerability Listing: It catalogs identified vulnerabilities for mitigation or monitoring.
   - Complexity Reduction: Threat modeling encourages a granular examination of application components, aiding in comprehending the application thoroughly and assessing the need for redesign or reprogramming.
   - Risk Reduction: While no application can be entirely risk-free, threat modeling helps minimize the area of risk exposure through additional security measures.

**2. Improved Quality Assurance:** By eliminating single points of failure and validating secure software configurations, threat modeling enhances quality assurance. Integrating threat modeling into existing testing practices provides a deeper understanding of potential security issues and can serve as a reference for incident response.

**3. Consistent Application Security:** Threat modeling provides a structured approach to evaluating application security, ensuring consistency and continuity regardless of personnel or timing.

**4. Enhanced Collaboration:** Threat modeling fosters collaboration among various stakeholders, including security engineers and developers. It aids in evaluating software introductions and their justifications, fostering professional connections and raising security awareness throughout the organization.

## The Threat Modeling Flow:

**1. Asset Identification:** Identify all resources, such as database servers and file servers.

**2. Architecture Description:** Define and document the software architecture.

**3. Application Decomposition:** Create data-flow diagrams (DFDs) for all processes and sub-processes.

**4. Threat Identification:** Compile a list of threats and vulnerabilities.

**5. Threat Documentation:** Document the identified threats.

**6. Threat Classification:** Classify threats based on their severity.

## DevSecOps Threat Modeling:

In DevSecOps, threat modeling commences at the planning stage and undergoes revision in each iteration (sprint). The DevSecOps approach involves the following steps:

**1. Understanding Requirements and Objectives:**
   - Research the application's operational environment.
   - Pay particular attention to the primary usage framework.
   - Incorporate new use cases and user stories.
   - Identify changes in security objectives and business requirements.
   - Assess the application's risk profile.

**2. Decomposition and Modeling:**
   - Understand new components and design processes.
   - Recognize alterations in trust boundaries and attack surfaces.
   - Identify available resources.
   - Decompose the software design and conduct a detailed review, creating data-flow diagrams (DFDs) to visualize data flow across trust boundaries and potential attack surfaces.

**3. Threat Enumeration:**
   - Analyze potential attack vectors.
   - Identify and categorize threats.
   - Explore new threats based on the updated threat model.

**4. Mitigation Analysis:**
   - Propose countermeasures for newly identified threats.
   - Guide application teams in mitigating risks associated with architectures and resources.

**5. Validation:**
   - Implement countermeasures.
   - Ensure no repetition of countermeasures.
   - Identify efficient countermeasures to address threats.
   - Determine any additional countermeasures required.

By adopting a comprehensive and iterative approach to threat modeling, organizations can ensure their security practices remain effective and comprehensible, even decades into the future.

# Incorporate Threat Modeling into DevSecOps

Threat models serve as valuable documentation that should be practical to maximize their utility. To render threat models practical, DevSecOps teams should adhere to the following outlined workflow:
1. Develop an initial threat model for the organization.
2. Transmit the outcomes of the threat model (mitigations for identified threats) to software tools such as Jira or Azure DevOps boards, which can monitor security issues and append items to a backlog.
3. Implement the necessary mitigations for the identified threats.
4. Deploy Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates or new features via the CI/CD pipeline along with the mitigation measures.
5. Ascertain existing gaps and validate them to ensure successful threat mitigation.
6. Integrate the status of mitigated threats and feedback from the process into the threat modeling platform. This cycle repeats as new threats arise and are mitigated, continuously providing documentation for security architects and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to reference as needed.

This iterative process is not a one-time occurrence; it continues indefinitely as new threats emerge and are addressed, with feedback consistently integrated into the threat model. This ongoing practice ensures up-to-date documentation on the security of applications.

## Threat Model Input for the Entire CI/CD Pipeline

The scope of threat modeling is tailored to meet the specific requirements of each individual story. Inputs are sourced from various perspectives, including those of clients, security analysts, and organizational managers. These inputs are then analyzed and categorized into straightforward questions such as:
- What vulnerabilities are associated with the assets?
- What could go wrong and to what extent?
- What constitutes the worst-case scenario?

This process aids in identifying security requirements, which are then translated into simple terms for easy comprehension. For instance, "X and Y are vital for the programs and must be safeguarded from unauthorized use" or "data ABC must remain confidential." Subsequently, countermeasures are documented, designed, and incorporated into the threat model input for the entire continuous integration/continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline. 

Threat modeling for the complete CI/CD pipeline can be executed through the following steps:
- Plan Security Requirements: Add or modify security requirements within the story.
- Build Security Controls: Integrate threat mitigation measures, such as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and security composition analysis.
- Test Cases: Generate test cases based on the threat mitigation use cases outlined in the story, encompassing Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) and Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST).
- Deploy Monitoring: Implement security measures as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and configure alarms based on the established test cases.

These steps can be viewed as cyclical, as the deployment of one application is succeeded by the planning of security requirements for the next.
